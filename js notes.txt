note in js:

****queryselector and getelement by id

**** object prototype and prototype inheritance

**** synchronous => allow things happen one at a time.

**** asynchronous => allow multiple things in a sametime.


****what is ajax in js

--> AJAX stands for asynchronous javascript and XML

--> AJAX in not a programing language. rather, it's set of existing technologies.

--> AJAX helps in fetching data asynchronus without interfering with the existing page.

--> AJAX no page reload/refresh

--> modern websites use JSON instead or XML for data transfer.

why use AJAX?

1 no page reload/refresh
2 saves the bandwidth.
ajax use the XMLHttpRequest to get the data from the server.

-->modern websites use JSON instead or XML for data transfer

**** what is JSON in js

=> JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.

=>JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page



****readystate value in xhr
0 => unset ,"client create but open() not called"
1 => opened 
2 => headers_received ,"send() has been called"
3 => loading ,"downloading ; responseText "
4 => done ,"the operation is complate."
4 =>done

ex=>
xhr.open('GET','harry.txt',true);
xhr.send();
true => means asnchronous in unblocking
false => means snchronous in blocking

****getResponseHeader means data send in url(link)
****setRequestHeader means data send in url

****promises
1 resolve
2 reject
3 pending

***arrow function
//one liners do not require braces/return
// one line will automatically return

****async is return promises

**** await => The await operator is used to wait for a Promise . It can only be used inside an async function within regular JavaScript code; 

****error handling
finally => this block is always execute
throw => the throw statment allow you to create a custom error

****regular expression
=> Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. 

regExp. source =>source is a read-only string property of RegExp objects
***regular expression function:
// 1. exec() -this function will return an array for match or null for no match
// 2. test() - return true or false
//3. match() - it will return arry of reuslts or null
//4. search() - return index of first match else -1
//5. replace() -returns new replaced string with all the replasement  (if no global flag is given ,first  match will be replaced)

****regular expression metacharacter 

regex = /^harr/; //^ means  expression will match if string  start with
regex = /ry$/; //$ at the end of the string means "string ends with "
regex = /h.rry/; //. matches any one character 
regex = /h*rry/; //* matches 0 or more character 
regex = /ha?rryi?/; //? after character means that character is optional
regex = /h\*rry/;  // \* allows asterik in the text. 

****regular expression character set

//character sets -we use []
//quantifiers -we use {}
//groupings  -we use prantheses for groupings ()

//iterators operator
// Iterator is an object which allows us to access a collection of objects one at a time.

//*******for in loop****** */
//in programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code
//for/in - loops through the properties of an object

//The for..in loop in JavaScript allows you to iterate over all property keys of an object.

//*****for of loop*****
=> The for..of loop in JavaScript allows you to iterate over iterable objects (arrays, sets, maps, strings etc...)

//****map in javascript***//
//maps in javascript : we can use any type of key or value

//****set in javascript***//
 //A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values.
//set store unique value

//****symbol in javascript***//
=> Symbols. A “symbol” represents a unique identifier. A value of this type can be created using Symbol() :.

=> Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript, along with string, number, boolean, null and undefined.
